1.1.

- In the interpreter: can store the value of the above expresion / result.
    
```python
>>> 5 + 4
9
>>> _
9
```

- Ignore values
```python
>>> a, _, _, b = (1,2,3,4)
>>> print(a,b)
1, 4
```

- Use as variable while looping
```python
for _ in range(5):
    print(_)
```

```python
1
2
3
4
```

1.2.

Even though we can find a similar use for ignoring values or storing values in loops, it is not the same as in Haskell.

When it comes to ignoring values, it is similar in the sense that we won't be able to reference this values later. However, it is not type-restricted, like in Haskell. Let's see an example:

```python
>>> a, _, _, b = (1,"a",3.12,4)
>>> print(a,b)
1, 4
```

Python's underscore can "catch" any type. However, in Haskell we are restricted to the types in the definition, for example the following won't be possible:

```haskell
uselessParameter :: Int -> Int -> Int
uselessParameter a _ = a
```

The following will throw an exception:

```haskell
uselessParameter 1 "hi"
```

Even though we do not care about the value for which we are using an underscore, anything that we use must be constrained to the type of the signature.

Although we can use _ for parameters (~variable), we will not be able to reference it later, let alone access its value. (both are possible in Python).

1.3.

```haskell
let f _ _ = undefined
```

```haskell
let g x x = undefined
```

if we give sth a name => we indicate that we want to use it



2.1. Both foldr1 and foldl1 have no base case. Therefore, can only be used with non-empty structures.

There is also a difference in the types at the definition of the function, let's take foldr and foldr1

```haskell
foldr :: (a -> b -> b) -> b -> [a] -> b
...
```

```haskell
foldr1 :: (a -> a -> a) -> [a] -> a 
...
```
